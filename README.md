# Fundamental-of-Computer-Graphics
The course will introduce the student the concept and theory of computer graphics applications. The course will also emphasize raster graphics application, generation of 2D primitives, 2D and 3D transformations, specification of windows and viewing camera. For further understanding on how computer graphics algorithms are applied, students will write graphics application software eg. Bresenham line, DDA line, 2D Circle, 3D object definition and representation, hidden surface removal and shading. At the end of the course, the student should be able to understand a computer graphics system and able to develop simple graphics application using standard graphics libraries.

ASSIGNMENT 2 My Bouncing Ball 2D Games 

Description
Assignment 2 aims to apply your fundamental knowledge both in CG and GL to produce 2D bouncing ball game
 
INSTRUCTION: 
Built and develop an interactive 2D Games Application as the user would be able to play the game by pressing any provided keyboard/button/menu. You should model at least 2 level games with different gameplay settings.



ASSIGNMENT 3 A 3D model in OpenGL

Description
Assignment 3 aims to introduce you to the 3D environment setting in the OpenGL domain.
 
INSTRUCTION: 
Built an interactive 3 layersâ€™ hierarchy of 3D objects. You may use all standard 3D objects in OpenGL or you may import other 3D objects from related sources such as the Turbosquid model (https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free).
