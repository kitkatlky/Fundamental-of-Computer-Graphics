# Fundamental-of-Computer-Graphics
The course will introduce the student the concept and theory of computer graphics applications. The course will also emphasize raster graphics application, generation of 2D primitives, 2D and 3D transformations, specification of windows and viewing camera. For further understanding on how computer graphics algorithms are applied, students will write graphics application software eg. Bresenham line, DDA line, 2D Circle, 3D object definition and representation, hidden surface removal and shading. At the end of the course, the student should be able to understand a computer graphics system and able to develop simple graphics application using standard graphics libraries.
